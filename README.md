# Paulius Zukas - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About

Hi, I'm Paulius! I'm currently on a journey to turn my passion for data into a career as a data professional. I have a background in Political Science, Customer Service and Payments. For quite some time, I've been digging deep into a rabbit hole of everything-data. I've been studying on my own, finishing various courses and practicing my skills as a data analyst.

I believe that data can often hold hidden information that is not immediately visible. It is only by asking the right questions and analyzing the data that we can pull valuable insights and make smarter decisions.

This repository serves to showcase my skills and knowledge in data analytics while sharing my projects with others. It also provides a way in the future to track my progress in this field.

## Certificates
I believe that the best way to display your skills is through the work you produce and share. That being said, sometimes certificates can paint a bigger picture. This list is outgoing, as I'm not only striving to build a strong foundation but also searching for ways to improve and innovate.
